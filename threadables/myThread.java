* There are two ways to use "Runnable" method. Either from
* implementing the Runnable interface in this example or by extending 
* a subclass from thread and using the run method from that class.
* This runnable allows us to use more than one thread from the CPU or
* in other words use more than one core from the CPU and run more than 
* one process at any time.
* 
* In this example I will be extending the Thread class and using a fixed
* thread pool to explain how one can complete multiple process at any time.
